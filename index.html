            <h3>Department Manager</h3>
            <p>Harris Teeter</p>
            <p>April, 2020</p>
          </div>
          <div class="job-summary">
            <p>I began working with Harris Teeter in 2020 due to COVID-19. All other previous work experience had been BOH kitchen work. As a department manager, I specialized in Harris Teeter's floral department, giving me a hands-on experience learning about design, merchandising, both shrink and financial management, marketing, and how to aggressively push to increase sales from the prior year.</p>
            <p>In my two years with the company I have been moved 3 times to different store locations, with more responsibilities on each move. I am now working at one of highest-volume stores in our district, which consists of over 10 stores. I have gained a reputation for being able to get struggling floral departments back on their feet and boost sales by impressively large margins. As I have only been at my newest location since May, this has been my greatest challenge so far, however, sales are finally beginning to increase by almost 7% compared to the previous year. </p>
